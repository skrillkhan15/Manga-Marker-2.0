## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light indigo (#7986CB) for a calm and focused reading experience with a frosted glass effect.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) with a subtle translucent layer to simulate a glass surface.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to highlight active elements and bookmarks, with a slight glow effect.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its legibility and clean design, used for both headings and body text. The font should appear slightly blurred to enhance the glass-like effect.
- Simple, clean icons for navigation and actions (e.g., bookmark icon, refresh icon). Give the icons a subtle frosted appearance.
- Clean, intuitive layout for easy navigation and readability. Use layered elements with transparency for a modern 'glass' look.
- Subtle transition animations to enhance user experience. Use blur and transparency changes to simulate the refraction of light through glass.
